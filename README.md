# Exploratory Data Analysing Using Youtube Video Data from My Favourite YouTube Channels
## 1. Aims, objectives and background
### 1.1. Introduction

Founded in 2005, Youtube has grown to become the second-largest search engine in the world (behind Google) that processes more than 3 billion searches per month [1](https://www.mushroomnetworks.com/infographics/youtube---the-2nd-largest-search-engine-infographic/). In fact, YouTube has one of the largest scale and most sophisticated industrial recommendation systems in existence [2](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2959100.2959190). For new content creators, it is a challenge to understand why a video gets video and others do not. There are many "myths" about the success of a Youtube video [3](https://vidiq.com/blog/post/5-youtube-algorithm-myths-youtubers-need-to-know-about/), for example, if the video has more likes or comments, or if the video is of a certain duration. It is also worth experimenting and looking for "trends" in the topics that Youtube channels cover in a certain niche.

Having recently stepped into the content creation world with a new Youtube channel on data analytics and data science, I gained some insights on this topic which might be helpful for other new content creators. The scope of this small project is limited to my favourite channels and I will not consider other niches (that might have different characteristics and audience base). Therefore, this project will explore the statistics of my top 10 favourite Youtube channels.
